# Specification Quality Checklist: Online Collaborative Document System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Result**: All checklist items passed

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Document version history: Not required for MVP (future enhancement)
2. Content format: Plain text only (no rich text formatting)
3. Sharing permissions: All shared users have edit access (no view-only level)

**Key Decisions**:
- Focus on plain text editing for simplicity in MVP
- Single permission level (edit) for shared documents
- Real-time collaboration prioritized over version history

**Readiness**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if additional questions arise)
