# Feature Specification: Online Collaborative Document System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-simple`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an simple online web document system. The system allows user to create its own doc. The system also allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Edit Personal Document (Priority: P1)

A user accesses the system, creates a new document, and edits its content. They can return later to view and modify their document.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without the ability to create and edit documents, the system has no value. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a single user creating a document, adding content, saving, logging out, and logging back in to verify persistence. Delivers immediate value as a personal document editor.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is authenticated, **When** they select "Create New Document", **Then** a blank document is created and opened for editing
2. **Given** a user has a blank document open, **When** they type content and save, **Then** the content is persisted and retrievable on subsequent visits
3. **Given** a user has created a document, **When** they navigate to the document list, **Then** they can see all their created documents with titles and last modified dates
4. **Given** a user selects an existing document, **When** they open it, **Then** they can view and continue editing where they left off

---

### User Story 2 - Share Document for Collaboration (Priority: P2)

A document owner shares their document with other users, granting them access to view and edit. Collaborators can discover shared documents and open them.

**Why this priority**: This enables the collaborative aspect but requires P1 to be functional first. Users need documents to exist before they can be shared.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by two users - one creating a document and sharing it with a second user, who then accesses it. Delivers collaborative value without requiring simultaneous editing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user owns a document, **When** they select "Share" and specify other users, **Then** those users gain access to the document
2. **Given** a user has been granted access to a shared document, **When** they view their document list, **Then** shared documents appear with an indicator showing they're shared
3. **Given** a user opens a shared document, **When** they make edits, **Then** other collaborators can see those changes on their next document load
4. **Given** a document owner wants to revoke access, **When** they remove a user from the share list, **Then** that user can no longer access the document

---

### User Story 3 - Real-Time Simultaneous Editing (Priority: P3)

Multiple users edit the same document at the same time, seeing each other's changes appear live as they type. User cursors and selections are visible to show who is editing where.

**Why this priority**: This is the advanced collaborative feature that provides the best user experience but is not essential for basic collaboration. Requires both P1 and P2 to be functional.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by two or more users opening the same document and typing simultaneously while observing each other's changes appear in real-time. Delivers enhanced collaboration experience beyond basic sharing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two users have the same document open, **When** User A types new content, **Then** User B sees the changes appear in real-time without refreshing
2. **Given** multiple users are editing a document, **When** they type in different sections, **Then** their edits merge smoothly without overwriting each other
3. **Given** multiple users have a document open, **When** one user moves their cursor, **Then** other users see a labeled cursor indicator showing that user's position
4. **Given** users are editing simultaneously, **When** network connectivity is temporarily lost, **Then** the system queues local changes and syncs them when connection is restored

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when two users edit the exact same character position simultaneously?
- How does the system handle very long documents (10,000+ lines) with multiple concurrent editors?
- What happens when a user loses network connectivity during editing?
- How does the system behave when a document owner deletes a document while others are editing it?
- What happens if a user's session expires while they have unsaved changes?
- How does the system handle special characters, formatting, or different language character sets?
- What happens when the maximum number of concurrent editors is reached?
- How does the system handle rapid successive edits (typing very fast)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Document Management**

- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to open, view, and edit documents they have access to
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete documents they own
- **FR-006**: System SHOULD provide document versioning or change history as a future enhancement (not required for MVP)

**Content Editing**

- **FR-007**: System MUST support plain text editing with multi-line content (no rich text formatting)
- **FR-008**: System MUST auto-save document changes at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 seconds)
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve formatting including line breaks, whitespace, and special characters
- **FR-010**: System MUST treat all content as plain text without styling or formatting markup

**Collaboration & Sharing**

- **FR-011**: System MUST allow document owners to share documents with specific users
- **FR-012**: System MUST grant all shared users full edit access (no view-only permission level)
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow document owners to revoke access from shared users
- **FR-014**: System MUST indicate to users which documents are owned by them vs. shared with them

**Real-Time Editing**

- **FR-015**: System MUST broadcast document changes to all connected users in real-time (within 1 second of edit)
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle concurrent edits by merging changes without data loss
- **FR-017**: System MUST display cursor positions of other active users editing the same document

- **FR-024**: System MUST maintain document integrity if a user disconnects during editing
- **FR-025**: System MUST handle offline scenarios by queueing local changes for sync when connection resumes

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents an authenticated person who can create and edit documents. Key attributes include unique identifier, username/email, and authentication credentials.
- **Document**: Represents a collaborative text document. Key attributes include unique identifier, title, content, creation timestamp, last modified timestamp, and owner reference. Related to User (owner) and DocumentAccess (sharing).
- **DocumentAccess**: Represents sharing permissions linking users to documents they can access. Key attributes include user reference, document reference, access type (owner or shared editor), and granted timestamp.
- **EditSession**: Represents an active editing connection. Tracks which users are currently viewing/editing which documents, including their cursor position and connection status.
- **Change**: Represents a single edit operation in a document. Key attributes include document reference, user reference, timestamp, operation type (insert/delete), position, and content. Used for real-time synchronization and potentially for version history.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create and save a new document in under 15 seconds from initial page load
- **SC-002**: Document changes made by one user appear to other connected users within 1 second of the edit
- **SC-003**: System supports at least 10 concurrent users editing the same document simultaneously without degradation
- **SC-004**: 95% of edit operations complete successfully without data loss or corruption
- **SC-005**: System maintains 99% uptime during business hours (8am-8pm user timezone)
- **SC-006**: Users can share a document and have another user access it in under 1 minute
- **SC-007**: Document content is correctly preserved through 100 rapid successive edits (stress test)
- **SC-008**: 90% of users successfully complete their first document creation and sharing without assistance
- **SC-009**: System handles documents up to 100,000 characters without performance degradation
- **SC-010**: Cursor positions for concurrent users are displayed with under 500ms latency

## Assumptions

- Users will have stable internet connections for real-time collaboration features
- The primary use case is text-based documents (code, notes, articles) rather than complex layouts or embedded media
- Document titles do not need to be unique across the system
- Users are identified by unique usernames or email addresses that are unique in the system
- The system will have a reasonable concurrent user limit (e.g., 100-1000 total concurrent users across all documents)
- Authentication mechanism follows standard web session or token-based patterns
- Browser-based access is the primary interface (not native mobile apps initially)
- Character encoding will be UTF-8 to support international characters
- Concurrent edits by multiple users will be merged automatically without data loss or conflicts
- Changes are automatically saved; there is no explicit "save" button required for P3 real-time mode

## Constraints & Dependencies

### Constraints

- Must work in modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions)
- Real-time collaboration requires persistent bi-directional connection between client and server
- System must handle network latency and intermittent connectivity gracefully
- Must prevent data loss even when multiple users lose connection simultaneously

### Dependencies

- User authentication system (may be built as part of this feature or use existing system)
- Network infrastructure capable of maintaining persistent connections
- Browser support for real-time communication capabilities
