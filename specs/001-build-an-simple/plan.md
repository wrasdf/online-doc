# Implementation Plan: Online Collaborative Document System

**Branch**: `001-build-an-simple` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-simple/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build an online collaborative document system that allows users to create personal documents and enables real-time simultaneous editing by multiple users. The system uses a modern web stack with Docker/Kubernetes deployment, React/Next.js frontend with Bootstrap UI, Python backend with RESTful APIs, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (Backend), JavaScript/TypeScript with React 18+ and Next.js 14+ (Frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Backend: FastAPI (REST API framework with native WebSocket support)
- Backend: uv (Python dependency management)
- Backend: FastAPI native WebSockets + Redis pub/sub (for real-time collaboration)
- Backend: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with Alembic (ORM and migrations)
- Frontend: React 18+, Next.js 14+, Bootstrap 5+
- Frontend: Yjs (CRDT library for collaborative editing)
- Frontend: CodeMirror 6 (text editor component)

**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ (running in Docker for local development)
**Testing**:
- Backend: pytest (unit, integration, contract tests)
- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library (unit/integration)
- E2E: Playwright (multi-browser, multi-user testing)
- Accessibility: axe-core + jest-axe + @axe-core/playwright

**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions), deployed on Kubernetes clusters
**Project Type**: Web application (separate frontend and backend services)
**Performance Goals**:
- API response time: <200ms p95 latency (per constitution)
- Real-time edit propagation: <1 second (per spec FR-015)
- Support 10 concurrent editors per document (per spec SC-003)
- Support 10,000 concurrent users system-wide (per constitution)
- Page load: <2 seconds (per constitution)

**Constraints**:
- Must use class-based Python code architecture
- Docker + docker-compose for local development
- Kubernetes-ready deployment (container orchestration)
- Real-time bi-directional communication required (WebSocket or similar)
- Must handle network latency and intermittent connectivity gracefully
- Browser-based only (no native mobile apps initially)

**Scale/Scope**:
- 10,000 concurrent users across all documents
- 10 concurrent editors per document
- Documents up to 100,000 characters (per spec SC-009)
- Auto-save interval: 15 seconds (per spec FR-008)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Code Quality & Maintainability
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Plan Alignment**:
- Class-based Python architecture enforces structure and single responsibility
- Separate frontend/backend promotes modularity
- Modern tooling (uv, Next.js) supports maintainability
- TBD: Linting configuration (Python: ruff/pylint, TypeScript: ESLint)
- TBD: Code review process and standards documentation

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Plan Alignment**:
- Testing frameworks specified: pytest (backend), TBD for frontend/E2E
- Test structure planned in project layout (tests/ directories)
- Feature spec includes comprehensive acceptance scenarios for TDD
- User stories prioritized (P1, P2, P3) enable incremental test-driven development
- Tests will be written before implementation per TDD mandate

**Action Items**:
- Phase 0: Research testing strategies for real-time collaborative editing
- Phase 1: Define test scenarios for each API contract
- Phase 2: Implement tests before any production code

### III. User Experience Consistency
**Status**: ✅ PASS with Notes

**Plan Alignment**:
- Bootstrap 5+ provides consistent design system
- React component architecture supports reusable UI patterns
- Spec includes UX requirements: error handling, loading states, cursor indicators
- Responsive design implicit in modern React/Next.js stack

**Notes**:
- Accessibility testing framework needed (axe-core, jest-axe, or similar)
- Design system guidelines needed for custom components beyond Bootstrap
- Need to establish error message patterns and loading state conventions

**Action Items**:
- Phase 0: Research accessibility patterns for collaborative editors
- Phase 1: Document UI component standards and error handling patterns

### IV. Performance Requirements
**Status**: ✅ PASS with Monitoring Plan Needed

**Plan Alignment**:
- Performance goals specified: <200ms API p95, <1s real-time propagation, <2s page load
- Scale targets defined: 10k concurrent users, 10 editors per document
- Technical choices support performance: PostgreSQL for consistency, WebSocket for low-latency
- Next.js provides built-in performance optimizations

**Concerns Requiring Research**:
- Real-time collaborative editing with 10 concurrent users requires Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDT algorithms
- Large documents (100k characters) with real-time updates may challenge performance goals
- WebSocket connection management at 10k concurrent users requires horizontal scaling strategy

**Action Items**:
- Phase 0: Research OT/CRDT algorithms for conflict-free collaborative editing
- Phase 0: Research WebSocket scaling patterns (Redis pub/sub, sticky sessions, etc.)
- Phase 1: Define performance testing strategy and metrics collection
- Phase 1: Design caching strategy for document retrieval

### Quality Gates Summary

| Principle | Status | Blockers | Action Required |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Code Quality | ✅ PASS | None | Define linting configs in Phase 0 |
| Test-First | ✅ PASS | None | Write tests before implementation |
| UX Consistency | ✅ PASS | None | Define accessibility testing in Phase 0 |
| Performance | ✅ PASS | None | Research scaling patterns in Phase 0 |

**Overall Gate Status**: ✅ PASS - Proceed to Phase 0 Research

**Structure Decision**: Web application architecture with separate backend and frontend services. This structure supports:
- Independent deployment and scaling of frontend/backend in Kubernetes
- Clear separation of concerns between API logic and UI
- Docker-based local development matching production environment
- Class-based Python architecture in backend/src/services/
- React component architecture with Next.js App Router in frontend/src/app/
