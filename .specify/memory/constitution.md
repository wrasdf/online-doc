# Online Documentation Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality & Maintainability

**All code MUST meet professional standards that enable long-term project sustainability.**

- **Readability First**: Code must be self-documenting with clear naming conventions; complex logic requires explanatory comments explaining *why*, not *what*
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module, class, and function must have one clear purpose; avoid god objects and monolithic functions
- **DRY Principle**: Duplicate code must be refactored into reusable abstractions; copy-paste code is prohibited
- **Code Reviews Required**: All changes must pass peer review verifying adherence to these standards before merge
- **Linting & Formatting**: Automated tools must enforce consistent style; no warnings allowed in production branches
- **Documentation Standards**: Public APIs, complex algorithms, and architectural decisions must be documented inline and in project docs

**Rationale**: Technical debt compounds exponentially. Maintaining high code quality from the start prevents costly rewrites and enables confident iteration.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**TDD methodology is mandatory for all feature development. No exceptions.**

- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Write failing test → Verify it fails → Implement minimum code to pass → Refactor
- **Tests Before Implementation**: Tests must be written and approved before any implementation code
- **User Approval Gate**: Test scenarios must be validated by stakeholders before implementation begins
- **Test Categories Required**:
  - **Unit Tests**: All business logic, utilities, and isolated functions
  - **Integration Tests**: API contracts, service interactions, data flows
  - **Contract Tests**: External interfaces, APIs, data schemas
- **Coverage Standards**: Minimum 80% code coverage; critical paths require 100%
- **Tests Must Fail First**: Every new test must demonstrate a failure before implementation; document initial failure state

**Rationale**: Test-first development catches design flaws early, provides living documentation, enables confident refactoring, and ensures user requirements are accurately captured before engineering effort is invested.

### III. User Experience Consistency

**All user-facing interfaces must provide predictable, accessible, and delightful experiences.**

- **Design System Adherence**: All UI components must follow established design patterns, spacing, typography, and color schemes
- **Accessibility Requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)**:
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Sufficient color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
  - Alt text for all meaningful images
- **Responsive Design**: Interfaces must be fully functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **Error Handling UX**:
  - Clear, actionable error messages (avoid technical jargon)
  - Graceful degradation when services unavailable
  - Visual feedback for all user actions (loading states, success confirmations)
- **Consistency Checks**: Before merging, verify new features match existing patterns for navigation, forms, modals, and feedback mechanisms

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves user satisfaction, builds trust, and ensures accessibility for all users regardless of ability or device.

### IV. Performance Requirements

**Systems must perform efficiently at expected scale without degradation.**

- **Response Time Standards**:
  - Page loads: < 2 seconds on average connection
  - API responses: < 200ms p95 latency
  - User interactions: < 100ms perceived latency (visual feedback)
- **Resource Constraints**:
  - Client bundle size: < 500KB compressed JavaScript
  - Memory usage: < 100MB for client applications
  - Database queries: < 50ms for simple queries, < 500ms for complex aggregations
- **Scalability Targets**:
  - Support 10,000 concurrent users without degradation
  - Handle 1,000 requests per second sustained load
- **Performance Testing Required**:
  - Load tests for all API endpoints before production deployment
  - Lighthouse scores: Minimum 90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices
  - Performance regression testing in CI pipeline
- **Optimization Mandatory**: Any feature exceeding these thresholds must be optimized before merge; document justified exceptions

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and business outcomes. Slow applications lose users, degrade trust, and incur higher infrastructure costs. Performance must be designed in, not bolted on.

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates

All pull requests must pass these gates before merge:

1. **Constitution Compliance Review**: PR description must document alignment with all four principles
2. **Test Coverage Gate**: Tests written first, all passing, coverage thresholds met
3. **Code Review Gate**: At least one peer approval verifying code quality standards
4. **Performance Gate**: Lighthouse scores and load test results within thresholds
5. **Accessibility Gate**: Automated accessibility checks passing (axe, WAVE, or similar)

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code only; protected branch requiring PR reviews
- **Feature branches**: Named `###-feature-name` pattern; must link to specification in `/specs/`
- **Hotfix branches**: Named `hotfix/description`; require expedited review but still must pass all gates

### Documentation Requirements

- Every feature must include:
  - Updated user-facing documentation
  - API documentation if applicable
  - Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant technical choices
  - Quickstart guides for new capabilities

## Security & Compliance

### Security Standards

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure session management; role-based access control where applicable
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits; automated vulnerability scanning; prompt patching

### Compliance Checks

- Security reviews required for authentication, data handling, and external integrations
- Privacy impact assessments for features collecting user data
- License compliance verification for all dependencies

## Governance

### Amendment Process

1. Propose changes via PR to this constitution file
2. Document rationale and impact on existing principles
3. Require approval from at least two project maintainers
4. Update all dependent templates (plan, spec, tasks) for consistency
5. Increment version according to semantic versioning

### Version Control

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to principles; removal or fundamental redefinition
- **MINOR**: New principles added or significant expansions
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes

### Enforcement

- All project members must familiarize themselves with this constitution
- PR reviews must explicitly verify constitutional compliance
- Complexity or deviations from principles must be justified in writing and approved by maintainers
- Constitution supersedes conflicting guidance in other project documentation

### Periodic Review

- Constitution must be reviewed quarterly for relevance
- Principles may evolve as project matures, but core commitments (especially Test-First) are permanent
